So the structure of this directory is supposed to make it easier to find and 
organise the icons from [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/). The 
folder structur is the author's username which can be dropped in the url to
make it easier to find authors--however, these icons can be renamed with values 
that are better suited to their purpose for SlamData. Also it's preferred to 
name as `${noun}-${adjective}`.
